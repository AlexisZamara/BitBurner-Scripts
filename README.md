# BitBurner-Scripts
A collection of my BitBurner scripts

# Basic Rules
These are the self-imposed rules that I refer to when creating new scripts for my game.

* Anything that can be automated through the in-game API must be automated.
* All automation should be handled by a main script.
   * The main script should be fire-and-forget.
   * The main script should take the fewest possible number of arguments.
* Limit the use of constants and hardcoded variables to exploits, regex, filenames and integers.


# Exploit Rules

* Bypassing the cost of call DOM methods is allowed.
* Accessing information through DOM properties is allowed.
* Using localStorage and sessionStorage to bypass the port limitations is allowed.
* Using DOM exploits to change the game behavior or automate things is allowed.
* Editing player properties is not allowed.
* Editing the save is not allowed.
* Bypassing the cost of in-game API calls is not allowed.
